RankCmdMsg & MaxRankMsg available wildcards:
%CUR_<branch>% - The current rank. Must use one of the following branches:
					-> %CUR_INDEX% - The index in the rank tree. [Natural-based: starts at 1]
					-> %CUR_NAME% - The name attribute.
					-> %CUR_GROUP% - The TShock group's name.
					-> %CUR_PARENT% - The parentgroup attribute.
					-> %CUR_COST% - The cost attribute parsed as SEconomy Money.ToLongString(true).
%NEXT_<branch>% - The next rank. Must use one of the following branches:
					-> %NEXT_INDEX% - The index in the rank tree. [Natural-based: starts at 1]
					-> %NEXT_NAME% - The name attribute.
					-> %NEXT_GROUP% - The TShock group's name.
					[No need for %NEXT_PARENT% since that's pretty much '%CUR_NAME%']
					-> %NEXT_COST% - The cost attribute parsed as SEconomy Money.ToLongString(true).
%MAX% - The number of ranks in the rank tree.

If you have any wildcard that you'd like to see added, please submit your request as feedback in the OP.
